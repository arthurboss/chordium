# TODOs

- keep scroll position when navigating away (stashed. requires cleanup)
- persist search when going to saved chord sheet and back to search
- add link to saved chord sheet to notification (showSaveSuccessNotification)


- Migrate SearchStateContext from localstorage to indexedDB, and check if it is even necessary

- check how to unify searches when results are most likely the same, such as:

"leonardo goncalves"
"leonardo gon√ßalves"

"oficina g3"
"oficina-g3"
