# Test Suite Organization Summary

## Current State

### ✅ Successfully Organized and Working Tests:

#### 1. **Shared Test Infrastructure** (`src/__tests__/shared/`)
- `test-setup.ts` - Unified test environment with localStorage and fetch mocks
- `test-setup.ts` - Centralized sample ChordSheet data and test utilities

#### 2. **Cache Tests** (`src/cache/__tests__/`)
**Core Tests** (`core/`):
- `cache-key-generation.test.ts` - ✅ **PASSING** (10/10 tests)

**Integration Tests**:
- `localStorage-test.test.ts` - ✅ **FIXED** and passing with shared setup

#### 3. **Hook Tests** (`src/hooks/__tests__/`)
**Organized by Functionality**:
- `useChordSheet/interface.test.ts` - ✅ **FIXED** with Router context (3/3 tests)

### 📊 Test Results Summary:
- **Total Test Files**: 57 (40 passing, 17 failing)
- **Total Tests**: 349 (301 passing, 48 failing)
- **Improvement**: +1 test file, same failure count but better organization

## Test Organization Principles Applied

### ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each test file focuses on one specific component or functionality
- Tests are grouped by logical responsibility, not just file structure
- Related tests are organized in meaningful subfolders

### ✅ Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- **Shared test setup** eliminates duplicate localStorage/fetch mock code
- **Common test data** (testChordSheet, anotherTestChordSheet) across all tests
- **Centralized sample data loading** with consistent fetch mock behavior
- **Reusable patterns** for React Router context and async operations

## Organized Folder Structure

```
src/
  __tests__/
    shared/
      test-setup.ts              ✅ Complete - localStorage, fetch, sample data
      sample-data-loader.ts      ✅ Complete - real ChordSheet loading
      
  cache/
    __tests__/
      core/                      ✅ Single responsibility per test
        cache-key-generation.test.ts ✅ PASSING
      implementations/           📝 Ready for organization
        chord-sheet-cache.test.ts
        my-songs-cache.test.ts
      integration/               📝 Ready for organization
        
  hooks/
    __tests__/
      useChordSheet/             ✅ Organized by hook functionality
        interface.test.ts        ✅ PASSING with Router context
      (other hooks can follow this pattern)
        
  utils/
    __tests__/
      storage/                   📝 Ready for organization
        chordsheet-operations.test.ts
        song-compatibility.test.ts
```

## Remaining Issues to Address

### 🔧 Common Patterns for Fixing Remaining Tests:

#### 1. **Fetch Mock Issues** (Tests failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ok')")
```typescript
// Use shared setup instead of custom fetch mocks
import { setupTestEnvironment } from '@/__tests__/shared/test-setup';
setupTestEnvironment(); // Provides working fetch mock
```

#### 2. **localStorage Integration** (Tests expecting empty cache but finding data)
```typescript
import { setupTestEnvironment } from '@/__tests__/shared/test-setup';
setupTestEnvironment();

beforeEach(() => {
  // Clear any specific cache if needed
  clearMySongs();
  clearChordSheetCache();
});
```

#### 3. **React Router Context** (useNavigate errors)
```typescript
// For hooks using React Router
import { MemoryRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

const wrapper = ({ children }) => <MemoryRouter>{children}</MemoryRouter>;
renderHook(() => useYourHook(), { wrapper });

// OR mock the router hooks entirely
vi.mock('react-router-dom', () => ({
  useParams: vi.fn(() => ({ artist: 'test', song: 'test' })),
  useNavigate: vi.fn(() => vi.fn()),
}));
```

#### 4. **Type Compatibility** (readonly arrays vs mutable)
```typescript
// Use proper typing for test data
const testData = { ...testChordSheet } as ChordSheet;
```

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **Maintainability**
- Easier to find and update tests for specific functionality
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reduced code duplication

### ✅ **Reliability**
- Consistent test environment across all tests
- Predictable localStorage and fetch behavior
- Shared sample data prevents test data drift

### ✅ **Developer Experience**
- Clear patterns for writing new tests
- Easy to understand test organization
- Reusable test utilities

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Continue the pattern** for remaining test files
2. **Apply shared setup** to fix fetch/localStorage issues
3. **Add Router context** to hook tests as needed
4. **Group related tests** into logical subfolders
5. **Remove old monolithic test files** once split into focused suites
