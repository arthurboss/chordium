/**
 * Data Transformation Pipeline Integration Tests
 * 
 * This test suite covers the complete data transformation pipeline:
 * DOM extraction → Result transformation → Final API response
 * 
 * The pipeline ensures that:
 * 1. DOM extractors include 'url' field for backend validation
 * 2. Result transformers properly strip 'url' field for frontend API
 * 3. The unified Song interface is maintained throughout the pipeline
 * 
 * This comprehensive test suite would have caught the song-only search 
 * failure during the frontend-backend unification.
 * 
 * Test files are organized by functionality:
 * - search-results-pipeline.test.ts: Search result processing
 * - artist-songs-pipeline.test.ts: Artist-specific song processing  
 * - unified-interface-validation.test.ts: Cross-source consistency
 * - edge-cases.test.ts: Edge cases and error scenarios
