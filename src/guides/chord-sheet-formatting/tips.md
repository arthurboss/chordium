# Tips

- Use square brackets [ ] around chords
- Align chords with the corresponding lyrics
- Use spaces to position chords correctly
- Each line should be either chords or lyrics, not both
- Separate sections with a blank line and section name in brackets
- Common section names: [Intro], [Verse 1], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Outro]
