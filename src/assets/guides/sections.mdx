# Sections

Each chord sheet should be divided into sections like **Intro**, **Verse**, **Chorus**, etc. Use square brackets (`[ ]`) to define section names.

### Example:

<ChordSheet>
[Intro]
[C]      [G]      [Am]
Let it be, let it be, let it be

[Verse 1]
[C]             [G]               [Am]
When I find myself in times of trouble
</ChordSheet>

Always place section names in square brackets on their own line, and align chords with lyrics.

## Common Section Names

Here are some commonly used section names:

- `[Intro]` - Beginning of the song
- `[Verse 1]`, `[Verse 2]` - Main song content
- `[Chorus]` - Repeated section
- `[Bridge]` - Transitional section
- `[Solo]` - Instrumental section
- `[Outro]` - End of the song
