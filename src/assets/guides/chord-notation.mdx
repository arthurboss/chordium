# Writing Chords

Chords should be written in square brackets (`[ ]`) and placed directly above the lyrics they correspond to. This ensures proper alignment when the chord sheet is displayed.

### Chord Notation:

<ChordSheet>
[C]    [Cmaj7]    [Dm7]    [G/B]    [Am7]
Basic    Major     Minor    Slash    Minor
chord    seventh   seventh  chord    seventh
</ChordSheet>

- Basic chords: `[C]`, `[G]`, `[Am]`, `[F]`
- Extended chords: `[Cmaj7]`, `[Dm7]`, `[Gsus4]`
- Slash chords (different bass note): `[C/G]`, `[Am/C]`

Make sure to space your chords appropriately so they align with the correct syllables in the lyrics below.
