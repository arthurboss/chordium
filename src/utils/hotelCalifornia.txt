[Intro]
Bm  F#  A  E  G  D  Em  F#

[Verse 1]
Bm                        F#
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
A                               E
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
G                         D
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Em                                         F#
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night

[Verse 2]
Bm                            F#
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
A                                           E
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
G                              D
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
Em                                       F#
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say

[Chorus]
G                         D
Welcome to the Hotel California
      F#                         Bm
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
              G                   D
Such a lovely face  (such a lovely face)
G                               D
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    Em                          F#
Any time of year (Any time of year)
              Bm      F#  A  E  G  D  Em  F#
