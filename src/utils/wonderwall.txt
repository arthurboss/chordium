[Verse 1]
Em7             G
Today is gonna be the day
              Dsus4                  A7sus4
That they're gonna throw it back to you
Em7               G
By now you should've somehow
              Dsus4            A7sus4
Realized what you gotta do
Em7                   G
I don't believe that anybody
       Dsus4       A7sus4          Em7  G  Dsus4  A7sus4
Feels the way I do about you now

[Verse 2]
Em7            G
Backbeat, the word is on the street
              Dsus4                 A7sus4
That the fire in your heart is out
Em7              G
I'm sure you've heard it all before
                 Dsus4             A7sus4
But you never really had a doubt
Em7                   G
I don't believe that anybody
       Dsus4       A7sus4          Em7
Feels the way I do about you now

[Pre-Chorus]
    C                D                Em
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
    C                   D                 Em
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
C              D
There are many things that I would
G       D/F#  Em7
Like to say to you
      G        D
But I don't know how

[Chorus]
          C    Em7  G
Because maybe
                Em7        C        Em7  G
You're gonna be the one that saves me
    Em7  C  Em7  G
And after all
                Em7  C  Em7  G  Em7  G  Dsus4  A7sus4
You're my wonderwall
